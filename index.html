            One part photographer with an emphasis in post-production of images,
            and another part graphic designer that canâ€™t help but put
            things in a new perspective. Everything I do is clear, conveys the message,
            and focuses on exemplifying the already strong points.

            My photography focuses on post-production that will push the
            image in a direction that extracts the feel of the original photo.
            If the photograph is composed in some fun way, I will aim to make it more playful.
            If the picture is gritty, I use editing to make it feel rougher. I think you get the idea.

            A group project where we researched the cause of bee population decline and presented
            information that would raise awareness about the issue. My role in this project was
            to take the research and come up with how we would present the information to
            multiple audiences through the means of a website.
