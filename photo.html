            This image I originally took started off by lacking character due to
            it being overly yellow without any details emphasived. It is easy to pass
            over this image because after a quick look there is nothing that grabs the viewers eye.
          </p>
          <p class="fontcol2 botmarg">
            To solve this problem, I needed to make the photo more dramatic.
            In photoshop, I used primarily the contrast and saturation adjustment
            tools and turned them up. This increased how vivid the photo was, and
            it made details pop out. The effect: an overly-dramatic banana that carries
            a heaver tone than the original banana photo.

            The first picture of the person climbing the wall already has some character
            and interesting composition to it. It started off a strong image with a story
            to it. However, the main issue with this photo is the overexposure in the background.
          </p>
          <p class="fontcol2 botmarg">
            For this photo, instead of trying to correct the background, I took a more unique
            approach. I took the second photo of the clouds with the earthy tone to them. This
            tone is important because it matched the original image and makes the editing process
            smoother. I masked the background in the original image on the top-right, and I cut off
            the bottom part of the wall. On this mask, I added the clouds, made minor colour adjustments,
            and feathered the edges to make it look like the wall is actually in the sky.
            Now, not only is the background problem fixed, but I added to the narrative of the guy climbing
            the wall by making that wall somehow be in the clouds.

            This photograph of a spoon in bushes had great contrast and subject focus. The shallow
            depth of field focused intently on the spoon and the details surrounding it. As with the
            other images, these qualities had the potential to be exemplified.
          </p>

          <p class="fontcol2 botmarg">
            The biggest and most evident change I made was the change to grayscale. The reasoning
            for this change is that the green colour of the bushes was more of a distraction to the key elements
            of the photo. Grayscale images put more emphasis on composition, texture, and contrast, so it was
            the obvious first move to make in this case. From there, I turned down the contrast to give the bushes
            smoother looking leaves to them.
