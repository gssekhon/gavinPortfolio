            The problem presented to our group was that we needed to display facts and information
            about the bee population decline that has been occurring in recent years, specifically,
            in Ontario, Canada. We were to taken an unbiased stance on the situation and simply present
            the problems, viable solutions, and present it to the target audience.
          </p>
          <p class="fontcol1">
            Our main audience is the lay person, as one of the main solutions we
            identified relies on the awareness of the general public. Our goal is to
            spread awareness on how to save the bees, and most people are not
            aware of the problem at is plaguing society and how they can help.

            We researched the topic and came up all the information needed, and then
            we took it and needed to design a way for it to be communicated on the web.
            This is where the majority of my work came in.
          </p>
          <p class="fontcol1 botmarg">
            We started with making mockups for how the data would be visually represented
            for a lay audience.

          <p class="fontcol1 botmarg">
            From here, we finalized out final website and incorporated the research to make
            a parallax website that could display the information to a lay audience without
            seeming like a boring government website.
