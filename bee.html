          <p class="fontcol1">
            The problem presented to our group was that we needed to display facts and information
            about the bee population decline that has been occurring in recent years, specifically,
            in Ontario, Canada. We were to taken an unbiased stance on the situation and simply present
            the problems, viable solutions, and present it to the target audience.
          </p>
          <p class="fontcol1 botmargph">
            We researched the topic and came up all the information needed, and then
            we took it and needed to design a way for it to be communicated on the web.
            This is where the majority of my work came in.
          </p>

          <div class="lineup-cent">
            <h2 class="fontcol1">Mockups</h2>
          </div>

          <p class="fontcol1">
            Our main audience is the lay person, as one of the main solutions we
            identified relies on the awareness of the general public. Our goal is to
            spread awareness on how to save the bees, and most people are not
            aware of the problem at is plaguing society and how they can help.
          </p>

          <p class="fontcol1">
            We started with making mockups for how the data would be visually represented
            for a lay audience. My role in this was to design the interface, and make stylistic
            decisions that would accomodate the needs of the website. I took the important information,
            made sure it was displayed, and then

          <div class="lineup-cent">
            <h2 class="fontcol1">Final</h2>
          </div>

          <p class="fontcol1">
            From here, we finalized out final website and incorporated the research to make
            a parallax website that could display the information to a lay audience without
            seeming like a boring government website.
          </p>
          <p class="fontcol1">
            The parallax design of the website makes it feel as if the bees in the background are
            flying upwards on the screen. The design and layout stays static throughout scrolling
            on the page. This keeps it uniform and easier for a lay person to read, while adding
            enough flair to keep them interested.
